# Coursera-Practical-ML-Assignment
An assignment for Coursera Practical Machine Learning course

In this repository are 3 R files:

File | Description 
---- | -----------
modelFit.R  | Temporary file used to explore data and fit models
ModelValidationAndPrediction.R | File used to explore validating the fitted models
FinalReport.Rmd | The R Markdown report file.

After the FinalReport.Rmd file is complete and converted to html, I pushed a copy of FinalReport.html to the gh-pages branch as index.html so that this can be viewed via github.
